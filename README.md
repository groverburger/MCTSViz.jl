# MCTSViz.jl

A visualization tool for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) solver trees from [MCTS.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPOMDP/MCTS.jl), designed for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) defined with [POMDPs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPOMDP/POMDPs.jl).

This tool provides an interactive GUI to explore the MCTS tree, inspect node properties (like Q-values and visit counts), and understand the solver's decision-making process.

## Usage

The primary function for visualization is `mcts_viz`. You can use it by passing an MDP object and the MCTS policy generated by `MCTS.jl`.

```julia
using MCTSViz
using POMDPs
using MCTS

# Assume `my_mdp` is your MDP object compliant with POMDPs.jl
# and `mcts_policy` is the result of `solve(MCTSSolver(...), my_mdp)`

mcts_viz(my_mdp, mcts_policy)
```

This will open a window displaying the MCTS tree, which you can pan, zoom, and interact with by clicking on nodes to expand or collapse them.

## Example

The project includes an example using a simple GridWorld MDP. You can run this example to see the visualizer in action.

The file `src/example_mdp.jl` contains the `GridWorldMDP` definition and an `example_mdp()` function that sets up and runs the visualization.

To run the example:

1.  Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
2.  Import the `MCTSViz` module.
3.  Call the `example_mdp()` function.

```julia
using MCTSViz

# This function will create a GridWorld MDP, solve it with MCTS,
# and then launch the visualizer.
MCTSViz.example_mdp()
```

This will demonstrate how to use `mcts_viz` and allow you to explore the MCTS tree for the `GridWorldMDP` problem.
